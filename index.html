                    <p>
                        I’m a Computer Engineer who loves pushing the boundaries of hardware and software. Whether it’s optimizing GPU performance, 
                        building embedded systems, or reverse-engineering firmware, I enjoy tackling complex challenges at the intersection of 
                        performance, security, and efficiency. I’ve worked with CUDA, FPGAs, microcontrollers, and low-level system design, always 
                        looking for ways to make things run faster, smarter, and more securely.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Right now, I’m a Graduate Teaching Assistant, helping students navigate GPU architecture, microcontroller programming, and 
                        system design. When I’m not teaching, I’m deep into GHIDRA, QEMU, and low-level debugging, exploring how systems work under 
                        the hood. My projects range from hardware security enforcement to real-time embedded computing, and I love the challenge 
                        of fine-tuning performance at both the hardware and software level.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Outside of engineering, I like to keep things fun and creative. I enjoy playing games, watching movies, and hitting the cricket field whenever I get the chance. Photography is another thing I love—I’m always looking for interesting shots, whether it’s a cool landscape or just capturing everyday moments. Back in my undergrad, I was the Head of the Decor Department, which was a blast because I got to work on arts and crafts, designing event setups, and bringing creative ideas to life. Whether it's working on hardware or making something from scratch, I just enjoy building things that stand out.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you're into high-performance computing, hardware-optimized solutions, or just a good cricket match, let’s connect!
